{"text": "Elephants are known to live in matriarchal-led, close-knit social groups."}
{"text": "After the great apes, elephants are considered to be the world’s most intelligent land mammal. Elephants are known to have remarkable memories. They can also make and use tools; breaking off leafy branches and using them as fly swatters."}
{"text": "Elephants are sentient beings. They exhibit empathy towards other elephants who are in distress, offer protection to young or injured elephants and are capable of understanding deaths; for instance, they would stay by the dead elephant’s body and attempt to bury it."}
{"text": "Wild elephants help to maintain the forest’s ecosystem dynamics by playing a vital role in seed dispersal especially for fruits with large seeds and in nutrient cycling hence known as mega-gardeners of the forest."}
{"text": "Wild elephants are known as ecosystem engineers because they can modify habitats for many other animals. As they travel, they create pathways and when they dig the soil for nutrients, they create saltlicks. Some of these geological changes in the landscape can last for generations."}
{"text": "Asian elephants can grow up to 2.7 metres in height with a weight of between 3,000 and 6,000 kilogrammes, while African elephants can grow up to 3 metres in height and weigh between 4,000 and 7,500 kilogrammes."}
{"text": "Adult elephants can eat up to 150 kg of food a day from more than 100 species of plants. Their diet consists of plant material like bamboo, grass, leaf, bark, twig, fruit and tuber."}

{"text": "Malaysia is one of the 13 remaining countries in Asia still blessed to have elephants in the wild."}
{"text": "An elephant can poop up to 18 times in a day and produce about one tonne of dung per week. Elephant dung plays an important role in keeping the soil fertile and provides nutrients to seeds that the elephant swallows and defecates."}

{"text": "Well-connected wildlife habitats are vital for the survival of elephants. When infrastructures such as roads cut across wildlife habitat, it becomes a barrier that prevents elephants from moving from one side to the other. Apart from that, oncoming traffic increases the risks of elephant mortality."}
{"text": "Due to land competition and habitat fragmentation, humans will come into contact more frequently with elephants and conflict may occur. To prevent further loss of elephant range, we need to support and help farmers, so they are able to share the landscape with wild elephants (co-exist)."}
